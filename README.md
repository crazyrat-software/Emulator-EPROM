#EEPROM-Emulator

This is a legacy project written in polish language as a diploma thesis at a technical school. This was so long time ago, so I barely remember how it works, but it works. I still do have working hardware and with help of virtualization software you can run it on DOS/Windows OS without issues.
No support though.
